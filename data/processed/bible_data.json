            "Obviously, I’m not trying to win the approval of people, but of God. If pleasing people were my goal, I would not be Christ’s servant.",
            "Dear brothers and sisters, I want you to understand that the gospel message I preach is not based on mere human reasoning.",
            "I received my message from no human source, and no one taught me. Instead, I received it by direct revelation from Jesus Christ.",
            "You know what I was like when I followed the Jewish religion—how I violently persecuted God’s church. I did my best to destroy it.",
            "I was far ahead of my fellow Jews in my zeal for the traditions of my ancestors.",
            "But even before I was born, God chose me and called me by his marvelous grace. Then it pleased him",
            "to reveal his Son to me so that I would proclaim the Good News about Jesus to the Gentiles. When this happened, I did not rush out to consult with any human being.",
            "Nor did I go up to Jerusalem to consult with those who were apostles before I was. Instead, I went away into Arabia, and later I returned to the city of Damascus.",
            "Then three years later I went to Jerusalem to get to know Peter, and I stayed with him for fifteen days.",

            "Then fourteen years later I went back to Jerusalem again, this time with Barnabas; and Titus came along, too.",
            "I went there because God revealed to me that I should go. While I was there I met privately with those considered to be leaders of the church and shared with them the message I had been preaching to the Gentiles. I wanted to make sure that we were in agreement, for fear that all my efforts had been wasted and I was running the race for nothing.",
            "And they supported me and did not even demand that my companion Titus be circumcised, though he was a Gentile.",
            "Even that question came up only because of some so-called believers there—false ones, really —who were secretly brought in. They sneaked in to spy on us and take away the freedom we have in Christ Jesus. They wanted to enslave us and force us to follow their Jewish regulations.",
            "But we refused to give in to them for a single moment. We wanted to preserve the truth of the gospel message for you.",
            "And the leaders of the church had nothing to add to what I was preaching. (By the way, their reputation as great leaders made no difference to me, for God has no favorites.)",
            "Instead, they saw that God had given me the responsibility of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, just as he had given Peter the responsibility of preaching to the Jews.",
            "For the same God who worked through Peter as the apostle to the Jews also worked through me as the apostle to the Gentiles.",
            "In fact, James, Peter, and John, who were known as pillars of the church, recognized the gift God had given me, and they accepted Barnabas and me as their co-workers. They encouraged us to keep preaching to the Gentiles, while they continued their work with the Jews.",
            "Their only suggestion was that we keep on helping the poor, which I have always been eager to do.",
            "But when Peter came to Antioch, I had to oppose him to his face, for what he did was very wrong.",
            "When he first arrived, he ate with the Gentile believers, who were not circumcised. But afterward, when some friends of James came, Peter wouldn’t eat with the Gentiles anymore. He was afraid of criticism from these people who insisted on the necessity of circumcision.",
            "As a result, other Jewish believers followed Peter’s hypocrisy, and even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.",
            "When I saw that they were not following the truth of the gospel message, I said to Peter in front of all the others, “Since you, a Jew by birth, have discarded the Jewish laws and are living like a Gentile, why are you now trying to make these Gentiles follow the Jewish traditions?",
            "“You and I are Jews by birth, not ‘sinners’ like the Gentiles.",
            "Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law.”",
            "But suppose we seek to be made right with God through faith in Christ and then we are found guilty because we have abandoned the law. Would that mean Christ has led us into sin? Absolutely not!",
            "Rather, I am a sinner if I rebuild the old system of law I already tore down.",
            "For when I tried to keep the law, it condemned me. So I died to the law—I stopped trying to meet all its requirements—so that I might live for God.",
            "My old self has been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. So I live in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.",
            "I do not treat the grace of God as meaningless. For if keeping the law could make us right with God, then there was no need for Christ to die."

            "Oh, foolish Galatians! Who has cast an evil spell on you? For the meaning of Jesus Christ’s death was made as clear to you as if you had seen a picture of his death on the cross.",
            "Let me ask you this one question: Did you receive the Holy Spirit by obeying the law of Moses? Of course not! You received the Spirit because you believed the message you heard about Christ.",
            "How foolish can you be? After starting your new lives in the Spirit, why are you now trying to become perfect by your own human effort?",
            "Have you experienced so much for nothing? Surely it was not in vain, was it?",
            "I ask you again, does God give you the Holy Spirit and work miracles among you because you obey the law? Of course not! It is because you believe the message you heard about Christ.",
            "In the same way, “Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith.”",
            "The real children of Abraham, then, are those who put their faith in God.",
            "What’s more, the Scriptures looked forward to this time when God would declare the Gentiles to be righteous because of their faith. God proclaimed this good news to Abraham long ago when he said, “All nations will be blessed through you.”",
            "So all who put their faith in Christ share the same blessing Abraham received because of his faith.",
            "But those who depend on the law to make them right with God are under his curse, for the Scriptures say, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the commands that are written in God’s Book of the Law.”",
            "So it is clear that no one can be made right with God by trying to keep the law. For the Scriptures say, “It is through faith that a righteous person has life.”",
            "This way of faith is very different from the way of law, which says, “It is through obeying the law that a person has life.”",
            "But Christ has rescued us from the curse pronounced by the law. When he was hung on the cross, he took upon himself the curse for our wrongdoing. For it is written in the Scriptures, “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.”",
            "Through Christ Jesus, God has blessed the Gentiles with the same blessing he promised to Abraham, so that we who are believers might receive the promised Holy Spirit through faith.",
            "Dear brothers and sisters, here’s an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or amend an irrevocable agreement, so it is in this case.",
            "God gave the promises to Abraham and his child. And notice that the Scripture doesn’t say “to his children, ” as if it meant many descendants. Rather, it says “to his child”—and that, of course, means Christ.",
            "This is what I am trying to say: The agreement God made with Abraham could not be canceled 430 years later when God gave the law to Moses. God would be breaking his promise.",
            "For if the inheritance could be received by keeping the law, then it would not be the result of accepting God’s promise. But God graciously gave it to Abraham as a promise.",
            "Why, then, was the law given? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins. But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the child who was promised. God gave his law through angels to Moses, who was the mediator between God and the people.",
            "Now a mediator is helpful if more than one party must reach an agreement. But God, who is one, did not use a mediator when he gave his promise to Abraham.",
            "Is there a conflict, then, between God’s law and God’s promises? Absolutely not! If the law could give us new life, we could be made right with God by obeying it.",
            "But the Scriptures declare that we are all prisoners of sin, so we receive God’s promise of freedom only by believing in Jesus Christ.",
            "Before the way of faith in Christ was available to us, we were placed under guard by the law. We were kept in protective custody, so to speak, until the way of faith was revealed.",
            "Let me put it another way. The law was our guardian until Christ came; it protected us until we could be made right with God through faith.",
            "And now that the way of faith has come, we no longer need the law as our guardian.",
            "For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus.",
            "And all who have been united with Christ in baptism have put on Christ, like putting on new clothes.",
            "There is no longer Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male and female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.",
            "And now that you belong to Christ, you are the true children of Abraham. You are his heirs, and God’s promise to Abraham belongs to you."

            "And that’s the way it was with us before Christ came. We were like children; we were slaves to the basic spiritual principles of this world.",
            "But when the right time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, subject to the law.",
            "God sent him to buy freedom for us who were slaves to the law, so that he could adopt us as his very own children.",
            "And because we are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, prompting us to call out, “Abba, Father.”",

            "But even though my condition tempted you to reject me, you did not despise me or turn me away. No, you took me in and cared for me as though I were an angel from God or even Christ Jesus himself.",

            "Oh, my dear children! I feel as if I’m going through labor pains for you again, and they will continue until Christ is fully developed in your lives.",

            "The son of the slave wife was born in a human attempt to bring about the fulfillment of God’s promise. But the son of the freeborn wife was born as God’s own fulfillment of his promise.",
            "These two women serve as an illustration of God’s two covenants. The first woman, Hagar, represents Mount Sinai where people received the law that enslaved them.",
            "And now Jerusalem is just like Mount Sinai in Arabia, because she and her children live in slavery to the law.",
            "But the other woman, Sarah, represents the heavenly Jerusalem. She is the free woman, and she is our mother.",

            "I’ll say it again. If you are trying to find favor with God by being circumcised, you must obey every regulation in the whole law of Moses.",
            "For if you are trying to make yourselves right with God by keeping the law, you have been cut off from Christ! You have fallen away from God’s grace.",
            "But we who live by the Spirit eagerly wait to receive by faith the righteousness God has promised to us.",

These two forces are constantly fighting each other, so you are not free to carry out your good intentions.",
